### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I'm a permanent researcher/INRIA Starting Faculty at [INRIA/IRISA Rennes](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-centre-rennes-university) in ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·, working in the area of [bioinfo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics) / [compbio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_biology) with a focus on microbes and antibiotic resistance
- My research has three main axes, **â‘  search engines for dna seq data**, **â‘¡ rapid diagnostics of antibiotic resistance**, and **â‘¢ computational metagenomics**, all of which involve software development
- I developed/co-developed (a non-exhaustive list) [ProPhyle](https://github.com/prophyle/prophyle), [ProphAsm](http://github.com/prophyle/prophasm), [ProPhex](http://github.com/prophyle/prophex), [Ococo](http://github.com/karel-brinda/ococo), the [RASE](https://github.com/c2-d2/rase-supplement) ecosystem, [SamSift](http://github.com/karel-brinda/samsift), [RNFtools](http://github.com/karel-brinda/rnftools), [Disty McMatrixface](http://github.com/c2-d2/disty), [DyMaS](http://github.com/karel-brinda/dymas), [SMBL](http://github.com/karel-brinda/smbl), re-engineered [NanoSim-H](https://github.com/karel-brinda/nanosim-h), and participated in the dev of [Seed-Kraken](https://seed-kraken.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- I occasionally contribute to large OSS projects such as [Bioconda](http://bioconda.github.io/) or [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/), and in the past I worked on the development of automatic [tactile maps for blind users](https://hapticke.mapy.cz/?lang=en) that now serve the community
