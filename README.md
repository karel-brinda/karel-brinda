### Hi there 👋

- I'm a PI at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en/), the French National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology
- My research focuses on Computational Genomics, especially **① search engines for dna seq data** 🔎🧬, **② rapid diagnostics of antibiotic resistance** 🧫, and **③ computational metagenomics** 🦠
- I developed/co-developed (a non-exhaustive list) [MOF-Search](http://github.com/karel-brinda/mof-search), [ProPhyle](https://github.com/prophyle/prophyle), [ProphAsm](http://github.com/prophyle/prophasm), [ProPhex](http://github.com/prophyle/prophex), [Ococo](http://github.com/karel-brinda/ococo), the [RASE](https://github.com/c2-d2/rase-supplement) ecosystem, [SamSift](http://github.com/karel-brinda/samsift), [RNFtools](http://github.com/karel-brinda/rnftools), [Disty McMatrixface](http://github.com/c2-d2/disty), [DyMaS](http://github.com/karel-brinda/dymas), [SMBL](http://github.com/karel-brinda/smbl), and participated in the dev of [Seed-Kraken](https://seed-kraken.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [NanoSim-H](https://github.com/karel-brinda/nanosim-h), and [KmerCamel🐫](https://github.com/OndrejSladky/kmercamel).
- I occasionally contribute to large OSS projects such as [Bioconda](http://bioconda.github.io/) or [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/). In my previous life, I worked on the development of automatic [tactile maps for blind users](https://hapticke.mapy.cz/?lang=en) that now serve the community
