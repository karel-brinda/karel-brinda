### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I'm a permanent researcher/INRIA Starting Faculty at [INRIA/IRISA Rennes](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-centre-rennes-university) in France, working in the area of bioinformatics/computational biology.
- My research focuses on: **â‘ ** search engines for dna seq data, **â‘¡** rapid diagnostics of antibiotic resistance, and **â‘¢** computational metagenomics.
- I occasionally contribute to large OSS projects such as [Bioconda](http://bioconda.github.io/) or [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/); in the past, I worked on [tactile maps for blind users](https://hapticke.mapy.cz/?lang=en).
